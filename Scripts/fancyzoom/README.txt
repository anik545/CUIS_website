This module adds FancyZoom 1.1 to your site. This causes all links that point directly to an image file to zoom the image in-place instead of opening it in a new page. FancyZoom does this automatically by locating the image links on each page, so there's no extra setup required.

FancyZoom works best with thumbnails linked to larger images. It works especially well with the Image Cache and/or Image Resize modules. To disable zooming on an image link, add the rel="nozoom" attribute to the <a> tag.

Configuration options are located at admin/settings/fancyzoom. The Farbtastic color picker will be used if you have the Colorpicker module installed.


*** INSTALLATION ***

To install FancyZoom simply upload the module to your Drupal site's modules folder (sites/all/modules, sites/default/modules, or sites/mysite.tld/modules). Before FancyZoom will work, you will need to download a customized set of FancyZoom script files from http://www.thinkyhead.com/design/fancyzoom and add them to the module.


*** FEE FOR COMMERCIAL USE ***

Please note! The author requests a one-time registration fee for the use of the FancyZoom javascript (linked above) on commercial or for-profit web sites. Please visit www.fancyzoom.com for more details.
