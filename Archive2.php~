<h3>Indian Republic Day Celebrations</h3>

    Time: </strong>4pm - 7pm <strong><br>
      Where: </strong>Mong Hall, Sidney Sussex College</p>
  <p> Republic day marks the transition of India from a British dominion  to an independent republic with its own constitution on the 26th  January 1950. It is one of the three national holidays in India and  while the main parade, Republic Day Parade takes place at the Rajpath,  in the national capital New Delhi, where the President views the parade,  state capitals also have their state celebrations. On Sunday 30th  January we too will be celebrating this momentous day in our own way!</p>
  <p>The renowned Dr Gordon Johnson will be giving a short talk as part  of our celebration. He is a prominent British historian of colonial  India and his main interests are the history of India since the late  eighteenth century and the more recent history of the University of  Cambridge. Among his many other actives are editor of the "New Cambridge  History of India", and President of Wolfson College, Cambridge until  2010. His publications include "The Cultural Atlas of India" and  "University Politics: F.M.Cornford's Cambridge".<br>
