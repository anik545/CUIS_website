<h2 class="accent">About Khayaal</h2>
<p>The Cambridge University India Society, CUIS, established Khayaal as an exciting new magazine published termly on paper, officially launched in June 2011. Literally translating to 'idea' or 'thought', Khayaal is a space for expression of opinion, debate and networking, creating quality interaction and strengthening the ties between the members of CUIS.</p>
<p>Each issue was designed to carry one article each from a current undergraduate student, a current graduate student and a distinguished senior member of Cambridge Alumnus of Indian origin or who is currently involved in research/work related to India. Whilst the undergraduate and graduate columns provide a space where current students share their aspirations for India, their ideas about life, their passion for their subject and what Cambridge has contributed to them as individuals, the senior member space brings the wisdom of experience to kindle the eager intellects of our keen young readers. </p>
