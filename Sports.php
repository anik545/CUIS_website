<h3>Cricket Match Against CU Pakistan Society 2015</h3>
<strong>When</strong>: Saturday, 26th November<br>
<strong>Time</strong>: 10:00am - 1:00pm
<p>On the morning of the 26th November India Soc did battle against  Pakistan Soc in 2 indoor cricket matches. After a professional warm up,  India was bowling first. Excellent bowling performances from all the  bowlers meant regular wickets were taken and the scoring rate was low.  Left with only 79 to win, Prashant Chand-Bajpai made short work of the  chase and we won with 8 wickets to spare!</p>
<p>The second match was much closer. We batted first but lost wickets  regularly and were reduced to 65 off our allotted overs. With such a  small total (especially for indoor matches) nothing but an exceptional  bowling and fielding effort would do. This is exactly what we produced  and amazingly, reduced Pakistan to about 40!</p>
<p>A massive WELL PLAYED to those who represented India Soc, and we hope  you all enjoyed it. Pak Soc have asked for a rematch which we will aim  to play next term. Hope you're all looking forward to it!</p>
<p><strong>Team:</strong> Anees Karatt-Vellatt, Urmil Mehta, Nir Shah, Akshay Deshmukh, Vijay Shyam-Sundar, A Agarwal, Pradipta Biswas,  Prashant Chand-Bajpai, Hammad Parwaiz, Tejas Dholakia</p>

<h3>Indoor Cricket Against CU Sri Lanka Society 2014</h3>
<p>On Sunday, the 14th of November 2014, we took on CU Sri Lanka Society  in an intersociety indoor cricket match at Fenner's. The matches were  played with high intensity with both the matches being very close. The  first match (main one) was won by India Soc and the second (friendly)  was won on the last ball by SL Soc. This was definitely a great event  and we look forward to organising more cricket matches in the future.</p>

<h3>T20 Cricket Against CU Sri Lanka Soc 2011</h3>
<p> <img src="Images/Sports/Sports_2020.jpg" alt="20/20 Cricket Match" id="noborder" align="left" height="242">On Sunday 19th June 2011 our very own India Soc took on Sri Lanka Soc in a 20/20 cricket match at Fitzwilliam Sports Grounds. We won the toss and elected to bat first, hoping to put their bowlers under serious pressure. Adarsh Bala and Akshay Deshmukh put on a huge partnership, with Akshay ultimately notching up a blistering century. As the ball continuously disappeared out of the ground we felt confident and in the end India Soc posted 159 off our 20 overs.</p>
<p>We started bowling well, and would have had an early wicket; however a controversial decision by their umpire meant that the initial breakthrough was denied. Their batsmen batted well and put away the loose deliveries and despite tidy spells from Debuyan Dasgupta, and Neeru Ravi, Sri Lanka Soc eventually chased down our score.</p>
<p>A massive thanks to all who played and whatever the result, we hope everyone had a great time.</p>

<h3>Intersociety Football World Cup 2010</h3>
<p>We were lucky enough to submit two teams, a men's team and a mixed  team into the Inter-Society Football World Cup played at Churchill  College on Sunday 31st October 2010. Both teams played tremendously and  we are proud to announce the mixed team took won by 3-0 against the SL  Soc mized team. Meanwhile, the men's team played brilliantly but   unfortunately lost to the eventual winners ABACUS on a closely contested  penalty shoot-out.</p>
<p>We want to thank everyone who played and all the supporters who turned up on the chilly afternoon.</p>
